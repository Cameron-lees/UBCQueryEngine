# UBC Query Engine

Allowing user to search UBC Metadata in an efficient and simplistic way.

## Configuring your environment

1. Install git (at least version 2.9; after installing you should be able to execute `git --version` on the command line).

1. Install Node LTS (8.X), which will also install NPM (you should be able to execute `node --version` and `npm --version` on the command line).

1. [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). You should be able to execute `yarn --version` afterwards.

1. Clone the repository by running `git clone REPO_URL` from the command line

## Project commands

In the project folder:

1. `yarn install` to download the packages specified in your project's *package.json* to the *node_modules* directory.

1. `yarn build` to compile your project. You must run this command after making changes to your TypeScript files.

1. `yarn test` to run the test suite.
